This repository was made for my involvement in the Doane Programming Team. 

It is so I can collaborate with others on the team easier.

Feel free to use them as reference after attempting the problems for yourself!

Not all the problems are solved and may have incorrect answers.

Also [a_new_alphabet](https://github.com/Johang727/ProgrammingTeam/tree/main/Python/a_new_alphabet) for some reason works on my laptop and kattis, but not on my desktop or GitHub. I dunno.

Anyways, have fun looking around at my scuffed code -w-
